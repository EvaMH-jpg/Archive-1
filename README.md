Made by Claude Johner (Photographer) and assistant Janine Antoine from 1968 to 1972 in Vietnam : <em>the ravages of war</em>


## PROJECT GOAL

I want to use the Vietnam war as an example to show that the wars through time haven't change in form / outcome / reason. 
I'm portraying the uselessness of the wars through the function of the media during wartime. The media stands inbetween the civilians and the soldiers and is thereby the communication tool to keep both sides informed.


## TRANSCODING

### *Transcoding 1* : Script of the script

- **Description** : This script has explanatory information as extra layer next to the original script of the record

- **Tool** : Indesign

- **Outcome** : Printed matter
[Script of the script.pdf](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/618a6812-87d7-4a31-b5e9-3b86057a215e/Script_of_the_script.pdf)

- **Lost in translation** : 


### *Transcoding 2* : Listening Excersise

- **Description** : I asked six different people with an diversity in background, studie and age to listen to the soundfiles of the record and try to visualise this.

- **Tool** : 

- **Outcome** : mp3 + jpg

- **Lost in translation** : The sounds are getting out of context, so the meaning changes of the sound files.


### *Transcoding 3* : Enviroment objects react on sound

- **Description** : I created in Cinema 4D water and trees that move on the sound of the record. I want to create a world were you can walk through. While experiencing the world around you, you are surrounded by the sounds of the Vietnam war. 

- **Tool** : Cinema 4D

- **Outcome** : mp4
